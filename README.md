# Secret Santa
This is a small program that automates the beginning of a secret santa exchange, where each participant draws a name out of a hat.
The program makes sure that each participant gets a gift, and each participant has someone to give a gift to.
The program doesn't display everyone's partner at once, so that can remain secret.
Everything is done without a UI, future versions will implement a UI
